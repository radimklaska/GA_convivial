# Convivial profile CXP

This is a Drupal installation profile that encapsulates our starting site configuration and basic scaffolding
like settings.php and Lando tooling.

## Structure

* `convivial profile`
    * **Drupal installation profile. Holds config, default content, scaffolding files like settings.php and Lando tooling.**
    * All changes here will propagate to active projects.
* `convivial-recommended`
    * **Very basic file structure that requires `convivial profile` in composer. Used as a starting point for new projects.**
    * "Use it and forget it."
* `[new-project]`
    * **New git repo based on `convivial-recommended`. Holds project specific things. Requires `convivial profile` in composer.**
    * New project code is hosted on GitHub and GitHub Actions replicate it to Pantheon.
    * `composer update` fetches latest changes form `convivial profile`.

## Starting a new site - overview

* Decide on new machine name. Make sure it's available on Pantheon.
* `Use this template` on https://github.com/morpht/convivial-recommended
    * Template provides basic file structure and pulls in the `convivial profile`.
    * Rename all mentions of `convivial-recommended` to new project name.

This profile is meant to be used in conjunction with `convivial-recommended` project template. To start a new project, you should:

* Create a new github repo from convivial-recommended as a template.
* Checkout new repo locally and edit .lando.yml (project name, local url).
* Run `lando composer install`
* Install site locally with Convivial installation profile.
* Create Pantheon Drupal 9 site from link here https://pantheon.io/docs/drupal-9.
* Edit drush/sites/pantheon/{project}.site.yml to add there Pantheon site hash instead of %hash%
* Edit repository secrets at github to add there Pantheon git url.
* Upload database from local to pantheon.
* Force push your repository to pantheon git.
* After first push, dev site at Pantheon should be functional.
