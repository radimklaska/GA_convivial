      value: "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-align-justify\">He co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film&nbsp;2001: A Space Odyssey, one of the most influential films of all time. Clarke was a science fiction writer, an avid populariser of space travel, and a futurist of a distinguished ability. He wrote many books and many essays for popular magazines. In 1961, he received the&nbsp;Kalinga Prize, a&nbsp;UNESCO&nbsp;award for popularising science. Clarke's science and science-fiction writings earned him the&nbsp;moniker&nbsp;\"Prophet of the Space Age\". His science-fiction writings in particular earned him a number of&nbsp;Hugo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nebula&nbsp;awards, which along with a large readership, made him one of the towering figures of the genre. For many years Clarke,&nbsp;Robert Heinlein, and&nbsp;Isaac Asimov&nbsp;were known as the \"Big Three\" of science fiction</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-align-justify\">Clarke was a lifelong proponent of&nbsp;space travel. In 1934, while still a teenager, he joined the&nbsp;British Interplanetary Society. In 1945, he proposed a&nbsp;satellite&nbsp;communication system using&nbsp;geostationary orbits. He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946–1947 and again in 1951–1953.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-align-justify\">Clarke emigrated from England to&nbsp;Ceylon&nbsp;(now Sri Lanka) in 1956, to pursue his interest in&nbsp;scuba diving. That year, he discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient&nbsp;Koneswaram Temple&nbsp;in&nbsp;Trincomalee. Clarke augmented his popularity in the 1980s, as the host of television shows such as&nbsp;Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World. He lived in Sri Lanka until his death</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-align-justify\">Clarke was appointed&nbsp;Commander of the Order of the British Empire&nbsp;(CBE) in 1989 \"for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka\". He was&nbsp;knighted&nbsp;in 1998 and was awarded Sri Lanka's highest civil honour,&nbsp;Sri Lankabhimanya, in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
