      value: "<p>He served as the&nbsp;Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fellow&nbsp;of&nbsp;Pembroke College, Oxford&nbsp;from 1925 to 1945,&nbsp;Merton Professor of English Language and Literature, and Fellow of&nbsp;Merton College, Oxford&nbsp;from 1945 to 1959. He was a close friend of&nbsp;C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis—they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as&nbsp;The Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a&nbsp;Commander of the Order of the British Empire&nbsp;by Queen&nbsp;Elizabeth II&nbsp;on 28 March 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Tolkien's death, his son&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including&nbsp;The Silmarillion. These, together with&nbsp;The Hobbit&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales,&nbsp;poems, fictional histories,&nbsp;invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called&nbsp;Arda&nbsp;and&nbsp;Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term&nbsp;legendarium&nbsp;to the larger part of these writings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of&nbsp;The Hobbit&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;led directly to&nbsp;a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy.&nbsp;In 2008,&nbsp;The Times&nbsp;ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". Forbes&nbsp;ranked him the fifth top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
