      value: "<p>Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of&nbsp;science fiction&nbsp;and&nbsp;horror&nbsp;by the respective absence of scientific or macabre themes, though these genres overlap. In&nbsp;popular culture, the fantasy genre predominantly features settings of a&nbsp;medieval&nbsp;nature. In its broadest sense, however, fantasy consists of works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians from ancient&nbsp;myths&nbsp;and&nbsp;legends&nbsp;to many recent and popular works.</p>\r\n"
