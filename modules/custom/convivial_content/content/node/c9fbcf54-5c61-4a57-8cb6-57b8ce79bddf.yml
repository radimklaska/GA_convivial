      value: "<p>Clarke began&nbsp;Jonathan Strange&nbsp;in 1993 and worked on it during her spare time. For the next decade, she published short stories from the&nbsp;Strange&nbsp;universe, but it was not until 2003 that&nbsp;Bloomsbury&nbsp;bought her manuscript and began work on its publication. The novel became a best-seller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years later, she published a collection of her short stories,&nbsp;The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories&nbsp;(2006). Both Clarke's debut novel and her short stories are&nbsp;set&nbsp;in a magical England and written in a&nbsp;pastiche&nbsp;of the styles of 19th-century writers such as&nbsp;Jane Austen&nbsp;and&nbsp;Charles Dickens. While&nbsp;Strange&nbsp;focuses on the relationship of two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in&nbsp;Ladies&nbsp;focus on the power women gain through magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke's second novel,&nbsp;Piranesi, was published in September 2020.</p>\r\n"
