      value: "<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (sometimes referred to as&nbsp;HG2G, HHGTTG, H2G2, or&nbsp;tHGttG) is a&nbsp;comedy science fiction&nbsp;series created by&nbsp;Douglas Adams. Originally&nbsp;a 1978 radio comedy&nbsp;broadcast on&nbsp;BBC Radio 4, it was later adapted to other formats, including stage shows, novels, comic books, a&nbsp;1981 TV series, a&nbsp;1984 video game, and&nbsp;2005 feature film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&nbsp;has become an international multi-media phenomenon; the novels are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005. The first novel,&nbsp;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&nbsp;(1979), was ranked fourth on the&nbsp;BBC’s&nbsp;The Big Read&nbsp;poll. The sixth novel,&nbsp;And Another Thing, was written by&nbsp;Eoin Colfer&nbsp;with additional unpublished material by Douglas Adams. In 2017,&nbsp;BBC Radio 4&nbsp;announced a 40th-anniversary celebration with&nbsp;Dirk Maggs, one of the original producers, in charge. The first of six new episodes was broadcast on 8 March 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad narrative of&nbsp;Hitchhiker&nbsp;follows the misadventures of the last surviving man,&nbsp;Arthur Dent, following the demolition of the Earth by a&nbsp;Vogon&nbsp;constructor fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent is rescued from Earth's destruction by&nbsp;Ford Prefect—a human-like alien writer for the eccentric, electronic&nbsp;travel guide&nbsp;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy—by hitchhiking onto a passing Vogon spacecraft. Following his rescue, Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters&nbsp;Trillian, another human who had been taken from Earth (prior to its destruction) by the two-headed President of the Galaxy&nbsp;Zaphod Beeblebrox&nbsp;and the depressed&nbsp;Marvin, the Paranoid Android. Certain narrative details were changed among the various adaptations.</p>\r\n"
