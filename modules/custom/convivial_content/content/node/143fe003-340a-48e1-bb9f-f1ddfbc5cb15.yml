      value: "<p>An early example was the&nbsp;Pete Manx&nbsp;series by&nbsp;Henry Kuttner&nbsp;and&nbsp;Arthur K. Barnes&nbsp;(sometimes writing together and sometimes separately, under the house pen-name of Kelvin Kent). Published in&nbsp;Thrilling Wonder Stories&nbsp;in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the series featured a&nbsp;time-traveling&nbsp;carnival barker who uses his con-man abilities to get out of trouble. Two later series cemented Kuttner's reputation as one of the most popular early writers of comic science fiction: the&nbsp;Gallegher&nbsp;series (about a drunken inventor and his narcissistic&nbsp;robot) and the&nbsp;Hogben&nbsp;series (about a family of mutant hillbillies). The former appeared in&nbsp;Astounding Science Fiction&nbsp;in 1943 and 1948 and was collected in hardcover as&nbsp;Robots Have No Tails&nbsp;(Gnome, 1952), and the latter appeared in&nbsp;Thrilling Wonder Stories&nbsp;in the late 1940s. In the 1950s comedy became more common in science fiction. Some of the authors contributing included:&nbsp;Alfred Bester,&nbsp;Harry Harrison,&nbsp;C. M. Kornbluth,&nbsp;Frederik Pohl, and&nbsp;Robert Sheckley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a comic science-fiction series written by&nbsp;Douglas Adams. Originally&nbsp;a radio comedy&nbsp;broadcast on&nbsp;BBC Radio 4&nbsp;in 1978, it later morphed into other formats, including stage shows, novels, comic books, a&nbsp;1981 TV series, a&nbsp;1984 computer game, and&nbsp;2005 feature film. A prominent series in&nbsp;British popular culture,&nbsp;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&nbsp;has become an international multi-media phenomenon; the novels are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Terry Pratchett's 1981 novel&nbsp;Strata&nbsp;also exemplifies the comic science fiction genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Red Dwarf&nbsp;primarily consists of a television&nbsp;sitcom&nbsp;that aired on&nbsp;BBC Two&nbsp;between 1988 and 1999, and on&nbsp;Dave&nbsp;since 2009, gaining a&nbsp;cult following. As of 2020&nbsp;eleven full series of the show plus two specials have aired. The latest series, dubbed&nbsp;Red Dwarf XII, started airing in October 2017. The three-part miniseries special&nbsp;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&nbsp;aired in 2009, 10 years after Series 8. The \"Television film\"&nbsp;Red Dwarf: The Promised Land&nbsp;aired in 2020 following Red Dwarf XII.</p>\r\n"
