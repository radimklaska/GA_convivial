      value: "<p>A Confederacy of Dunces&nbsp;is a&nbsp;picaresque novel&nbsp;by American novelist&nbsp;John Kennedy Toole&nbsp;which reached publication in 1980, eleven years after Toole's suicide. Published through the efforts of writer&nbsp;Walker Percy&nbsp;(who also contributed a foreword) and Toole's mother, Thelma, the book became first a&nbsp;cult classic, then a mainstream success; it earned Toole a posthumous&nbsp;Pulitzer Prize for Fiction&nbsp;in 1981, and is now considered a&nbsp;canonical&nbsp;work of modern&nbsp;literature of the Southern United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book's title refers to an&nbsp;epigram&nbsp;from&nbsp;Jonathan Swift's essay&nbsp;Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and Diverting: \"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the&nbsp;dunces&nbsp;are all in confederacy against him.\" Its central character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is an educated but slothful 30-year-old man living with his mother in the&nbsp;Uptown neighborhood&nbsp;of early-1960s&nbsp;New Orleans&nbsp;who, in his quest for employment, has various adventures with colorful&nbsp;French Quarter&nbsp;characters. Toole wrote the novel in 1963 during his last few months in&nbsp;Puerto Rico.</p>\r\n"
