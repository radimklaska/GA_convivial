      value: "<p>Diary of a Wimpy Kid&nbsp;is a series of fiction books written by the American author and cartoonist&nbsp;Jeff Kinney. All the main books are the journals of the main character,&nbsp;Greg Heffley. Befitting a teen's diary, the books are filled with simple drawings of Greg's daily adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the release of the online version in May 2004, most of the books have garnered positive reviews and commercial success. As of 2020, more than 250 million copies have been sold globally</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first,&nbsp;second,&nbsp;fourth&nbsp;and&nbsp;ninth&nbsp;installments have been&nbsp;adapted into films&nbsp;by&nbsp;20th Century Fox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The online game&nbsp;Poptropica, itself also created by Kinney, has released two islands themed after&nbsp;Diary of a Wimpy Kid, called Wimpy Wonderland and Wimpy Boardwalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diary of a Wimpy Kid&nbsp;officially began when Kinney brought up an idea about a middle-school weakling named&nbsp;Greg Heffley, who wrote about his personal life. In May 2004,&nbsp;FunBrain&nbsp;and Kinney released an online version of&nbsp;Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The website made daily entries until June 2005. He worked on his book for almost eight years, before showing it to a publisher in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 2006, during the&nbsp;New York Comic Con, Kinney signed a multi-book deal with publisher&nbsp;Harry N. Abrams, Inc., to turn&nbsp;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&nbsp;into a print series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book became an instant hit, and the online version received about 20 million views as of 2009. Nonetheless, many online readers requested a printed version; Kinney agreed, and in April 2007,&nbsp;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&nbsp;was published. To date, fifteen&nbsp;Wimpy Kid&nbsp;books have been released, plus one&nbsp;do-it-yourself book, and two movie diaries. A spin-off series is focused on Greg's best friend, Rowley Jefferson, and has three entries:&nbsp;Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal,&nbsp;Rowley Jefferson's Awesome Friendly Adventure, and&nbsp;Rowley Jefferson's Awesome Friendly Spooky Stories. In April 2009,&nbsp;TIME&nbsp;named Kinney one of&nbsp;The World's Most Influential People.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
