      value: "<p>The Time Machine&nbsp;is a&nbsp;science fiction&nbsp;novella by&nbsp;H. G. Wells, published in 1895 and written as a&nbsp;frame narrative. The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of&nbsp;time travel&nbsp;by using a vehicle or device to travel purposely and selectively forward or backward through time. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle or device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Time Machine&nbsp;has been adapted into three&nbsp;feature films&nbsp;of the same name, as well as two&nbsp;television&nbsp;versions and many&nbsp;comic book&nbsp;adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of&nbsp;fiction&nbsp;in many media productions.</p>\r\n"
