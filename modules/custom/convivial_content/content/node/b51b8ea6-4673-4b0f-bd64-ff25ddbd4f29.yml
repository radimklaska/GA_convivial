      value: "<p>The War of the Worlds&nbsp;is a&nbsp;science fiction&nbsp;novel by English author&nbsp;H. G. Wells, first serialised in 1897 by&nbsp;Pearson's Magazine&nbsp;in the UK and by&nbsp;Cosmopolitan&nbsp;magazine in the US. The novel's first appearance in hardcover was in 1898 from publisher&nbsp;William Heinemann&nbsp;of London. Written between 1895 and 1897, it is one of the earliest stories to detail a conflict between mankind and an&nbsp;extra-terrestrial&nbsp;race. The novel is the&nbsp;first-person narrative&nbsp;of both an unnamed&nbsp;protagonist&nbsp;in Surrey and of his younger brother in London as southern England is invaded by&nbsp;Martians. The novel is one of the most commented-on works in the science fiction&nbsp;canon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plot has been related to&nbsp;invasion literature&nbsp;of the time. The novel has been variously interpreted as a commentary on evolutionary theory,&nbsp;British imperialism, and generally Victorian superstitions, fears, and prejudices. Wells said that the plot arose from a discussion with his brother Frank about the catastrophic effect of the British on&nbsp;indigenous Tasmanians. What would happen, he wondered, if Martians did to Britain what the British had done to the Tasmanians? At the time of publication, it was classified as a&nbsp;scientific romance, like Wells's earlier novel&nbsp;The Time Machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The War of the Worlds&nbsp;has been both popular (having never been out of print) and influential, spawning half a dozen feature films, radio dramas, a record album, various comic book adaptations, a number of television series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It was most memorably dramatised in a&nbsp;1938 radio programme&nbsp;directed by and starring&nbsp;Orson Welles&nbsp;that allegedly caused public panic among listeners who did not know the Martian invasion was fictional. The novel has even influenced the work of scientists, notably&nbsp;Robert H. Goddard, who, inspired by the book, helped develop both the&nbsp;liquid-fuelled rocket&nbsp;and&nbsp;multistage rocket, which resulted in the&nbsp;Apollo 11&nbsp;Moon landing&nbsp;71 years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
