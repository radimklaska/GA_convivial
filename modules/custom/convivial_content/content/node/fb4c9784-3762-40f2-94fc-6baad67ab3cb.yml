      value: "<p>He was known for his works of&nbsp;science fiction&nbsp;and&nbsp;popular science. Asimov was a prolific writer. He wrote or edited more than 500 books. He also wrote an estimated 90,000 letters and&nbsp;postcards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asimov wrote&nbsp;hard science fiction. Along with&nbsp;Robert A. Heinlein&nbsp;and&nbsp;Arthur C. Clarke, Asimov was considered one of the \"Big Three\" science fiction writers during his lifetime. Asimov's most famous work is the&nbsp;\"Foundation\" series,the first three books of which won the one-time&nbsp;Hugo Award&nbsp;for \"Best All-Time Series\" in 1966. His other major series are the&nbsp;\"Galactic Empire\" series&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Robot series. The Galactic Empire novels are set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with&nbsp;Foundation and Earth&nbsp;(1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot stories, creating a unified \"future history\" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by&nbsp;Cordwainer Smith&nbsp;and&nbsp;Poul Anderson. He also wrote hundreds of short stories, including the&nbsp;social science fiction&nbsp;novelette \"Nightfall\", which in 1964 was voted the best short science fiction story of all time by the&nbsp;Science Fiction Writers of America. Asimov wrote the&nbsp;Lucky Starr&nbsp;series&nbsp;of&nbsp;juvenile&nbsp;science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asimov also wrote&nbsp;mysteries&nbsp;and&nbsp;fantasy, as well as much nonfiction. Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. Examples include&nbsp;Guide to Science, the three-volume set&nbsp;Understanding Physics, and&nbsp;Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery. He wrote on numerous other scientific and non-scientific topics, such as&nbsp;chemistry,&nbsp;astronomy,&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;history, biblical&nbsp;exegesis, and&nbsp;literary criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was president of the&nbsp;American Humanist Association. The&nbsp;asteroid&nbsp;(5020) Asimov, a&nbsp;crater&nbsp;on the planet&nbsp;Mars, a&nbsp;Brooklyn&nbsp;elementary school, Honda's humanoid robot,&nbsp;ASIMO, and&nbsp;four literary awards&nbsp;are named in his honor.</p>\r\n"
