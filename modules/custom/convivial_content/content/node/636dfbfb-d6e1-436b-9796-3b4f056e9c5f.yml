      value: "<p>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&nbsp;is a&nbsp;fantasy novel&nbsp;for children by&nbsp;C. S. Lewis, published by&nbsp;Geoffrey Bles&nbsp;in 1950. It is the first published and best known of seven novels in&nbsp;The Chronicles of Narnia&nbsp;(1950â€“1956). Among all the author's books, it is also the most widely held in libraries. Although it was originally the first of&nbsp;The Chronicles of Narnia, it is volume two in recent editions that are sequenced by the stories' chronology. Like the other&nbsp;Chronicles, it was illustrated by&nbsp;Pauline Baynes, and her work has been retained in many later editions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the novel is set in&nbsp;Narnia, a land of&nbsp;talking animals&nbsp;and&nbsp;mythical creatures&nbsp;that is ruled by the evil&nbsp;White Witch. In the&nbsp;frame story, four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a&nbsp;wartime evacuation. The youngest, Lucy, visits Narnia three times via the magic of a&nbsp;wardrobe&nbsp;in a spare room. Lucy's three siblings are with her on her third visit to Narnia. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfill an old prophecy and find themselves adventuring to save Narnia and their own lives. The lion Aslan gives his life to save one of the children; he later rises from the dead, vanquishes the White Witch, and crowns the children Kings and Queens of Narnia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lewis wrote the book for (and dedicated it to) his goddaughter,&nbsp;Lucy Barfield. She was the daughter of&nbsp;Owen Barfield, Lewis's friend, teacher, adviser and trustee. In 2003,&nbsp;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&nbsp;was ranked ninth on the&nbsp;BBC's&nbsp;The Big Read&nbsp;poll. Time&nbsp;magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
